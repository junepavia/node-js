## REQUIRE FUNCTION
Node allows you to re-use code
Allows you to take javascript file, executes it and returns a code from that file so that we can use it elsewhere.
> Syntax
```
require('http'), require('events');
const EventEmitter = require('events);
```
Lets you use node built-in functionalities.

### MAKING HTTP REQUEST
